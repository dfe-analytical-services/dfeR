\description{
Round any number to a specified number of places, with 5's being rounded up.
}
\details{
Rounds to 0 decimal places by default.

You can use a negative value for the decimal places. For example:
-1 would round to the nearest 10
-2 would round to the nearest 100
and so on.

This is as an alternative to round in base R, which uses a bankers round.
