\description{
Round any number to a specified number of places, with 5's being rounded up.
This is as an alternative to round in base R, which sometimes rounds 5's
down due to an international standard. For more information see the
round() documentation:
https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Round.html
}
\details{
You can use a negative value for the decimal places. For example:
-1 would round to the nearest 10
-2 would round to the nearest 100
and so on.

\examples{
round_five_up(2495, -1)
