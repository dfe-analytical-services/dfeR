\title{Perform an HTTP request with automatic retries}
\usage{
safe_req_perform(req, max_tries = 5, wait_base = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{req}{A request object created with \code{httr2::request()}.}

\item{max_tries}{Maximum number of attempts to perform the request.
Default is 5.}

\item{wait_base}{Base of the exponential backoff used between retries
(in seconds). For example, if \code{wait_base = 2}, the wait time between retries
will be 2, 4, 8, ... seconds.}
}
\value{
The HTTP response object from \code{httr2::req_perform()} if successful.
If all attempts fail, an error is raised.
}
\description{
This function performs an HTTP request using \code{httr2::req_perform()} and
automatically retries the request if an error occurs, such as network
timeouts or temporary server issues. It uses exponential backoff between
attempts.

\examples{
\dontrun{
req <- httr2::request("https://example.com") |>
  httr2::req_method("GET")
response <- safe_req_perform(req)
