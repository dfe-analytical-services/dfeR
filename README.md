The goal of dfeR is to help standardise R programming across the
Department for Education (DfE) and facilitate sharing of business
specific functions.

## Scope

This package is open to all of DfE and anything we think could be useful
to other programmers and analysts can be contributed.

Functionality for dfeR is expected to focus around the following:

1.  DfE specific formatting
2.  Working with Microsoft SQL Databases
3.  Templates for analytical projects
4.  Publication R Markdown Templates
5.  API wrappers for use internally

Documentation for what has been included in the package so far is on our
[pkgdown site](http://dfe-analytical-services.github.io/dfeR/).

We are also developing the
[dfeshiny](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/dfeshiny) package,
and expect any functions specific to public facing R Shiny dashboards
will live there.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Installation

dfeR is not currently available on CRAN. For the time being you can
install the development version from GitHub.

If you are using
[renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) in your
project (recommended):

``` r
renv::install("dfe-analytical-services/dfeR")
```

Otherwise:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dfe-analytical-services/dfeR")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Proxy

The need for setting proxy settings in order to be able to work with R
and Git within the DfE estate has now ended. If you previously run the
proxy script in previous versions of the dfeR package, then contact the
[Statistics Development Team](statistics.development@education.gov.uk)
to assist in cleaning out your system settings.
