## Introduction and prerequisites

The `dfeR` package can be used to create a new R project using the `create_project()` function. This function helps you set up a pre-populated project with a custom folder structure, making it easier to start your analysis or publication. In order to use this function, you will need to ensure you have the right software installed, and have an understanding of R projects and `renv`.

If you are familiar with all of the above, you can go to the [Using the create_project() function](#using-the-create_project-function) section of this page or the [create_project() reference](https://dfe-analytical-services.github.io/dfeR/reference/create_project.html) for an overview of the usage, arguments and examples.

You can create a project using the `create_project()` function using code or using the 'New Project Wizard' in RStudio. The 'New Project Wizard' is a user-friendly way to set up a new project without writing any code. This guide covers both methods.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed.

-   R for Windows (x64) - version 4.0.0 or higher
-   RTools (for Windows users and the version must match the R version)
-   RStudio
-   The `dfeR` package

See the information below for installing if you don't have these already.

### What is RStudio?

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It provides a user-friendly interface for writing and running R code, managing files, and visualising data. You can download R (language) and RStudio (IDE) from the DfE software center. You also must download RTools (a helpful R extension) at the same time to use renv.

### How do I install dfeR?

`dfeR` is available on CRAN and you can install directly from there by typing the below code into the console window in RStudio:

```{r install_dfer, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("dfeR")
```

The [dfeR documentation](https://dfe-analytical-services.github.io/dfeR/index.html) gives more details on options for installing.

### What is an R project?

An R project is a working directory designated for a specific analysis or project. It keeps all your scripts, data, functions and outputs together in one place. RStudio allows you to switch between your projects easily, meaning you can keep your different pieces of work separate from each other.

Whenever you are using RStudio, you should work in an R project. This makes sure you are set up in the correct working directory, so your code is pointing at the right folders and files. You can find out more in [this guide for using projects in R](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects).

### What is renv?

Packages and versions of R regularly update. Over time, this can cause code to break - e.g., if different dependencies are required for later versions of packages to work. Using renv creates a “snapshot” of your code and packages at the time you created it, which anyone can then recreate when they come to use your code. This means that you can be sure that the code you wrote will work in the future, even if packages are updated.

You should use the renv package for package version control in R. It creates a project-specific library, meaning that installing a new or updated package for one project won't break your other projects. This is particularly useful for reproducibility and collaboration, as it ensures that your project will work with the same package versions on different machines. You can find out more about renv on the [Analysts' Guide](https://dfe-analytical-services.github.io/analysts-guide/learning-development/r.html#renv).

### What is testthat?

`testthat` is an R package that helps you write and run tests to ensure your code works correctly. It allows you to create tests that check if your functions produce the expected results, run these tests to catch errors early, and gives you confidence that your code is reliable and behaves as intended. It's a valuable tool for maintaining high-quality, bug-free code.

See this [guide on testing](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-basics.html) by Hadley Wickham for getting started.

### What is a GitHub .gitignore file?

A .gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files or directories to ignore in a project. It helps you avoid committing sensitive information, temporary files, or other unnecessary files to your Git repository. By creating a .gitignore file, you can keep your repository clean and focused on the essential files needed for your project. Find more guidance on how to avoid revealing sensitive information on the [Analysts' Guide](https://dfe-analytical-services.github.io/analysts-guide/RAP/rap-statistics.html#avoid-revealing-sensitive-information).

## Using the create_project() function {#using-the-create_project-function}

The `create_project()` function is a part of the `dfeR` package and is used to create a new R project with a custom folder structure. It is designed to help you set up your project quickly and efficiently, with all the necessary components in place.

The function works by:

1.  **Setting up the core project structure**: The core project structure will either create an ad-hoc project folder structure, which includes folders for data, analysis and output, or a larger folder structure for publication projects, which includes more folders for different data, analysis, documentation and outputs.

2.  **Adding initial files**: The script creates some initial files, such as a template README file to help you get started with your project. It also initialises the `testthat` package, which is used for unit testing in R.

3.  **Customisation**: Other files or processes can also be initialised depending on whether you set extra arguments as `TRUE` or `FALSE`. For example, you can use customisation to create a GitHub .gitignore file or initialise the `renv` package.

### Where to save your project

You should store any projects that use Git outside of OneDrive. To create a folder in your C drive, type: 'C:/Users/[username]' into the File Explorer search bar and create a folder called 'repos'. For example, if your user was JBLOGGS, you'd type 'C:/Users/JBLOGGS'.

### Parameters

When creating a project using the `create_project()` function, you will need to decide on several parameters. These parameters are necessary whether you use code or the 'New Project Wizard' to create your project. If you are using the 'New Project Wizard', the parameters which need a `TRUE`/`FALSE` input will be set to `TRUE` by ticking a checkbox. The table below explains each of the parameters, their meaning and what you should take into account for each.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
parameter_data <- data.frame(
  Parameter = c(
    "path",
    "init_renv",
    "include_structure_for_pkg",
    "create_publication_proj",
    "include_github_gitignore"
  ),
  Meaning = c(
    "Folder pathway",
    "Initiate renv in the project",
    "Additional folder for package development",
    "Create project with structure for publications",
    "Include a GitHub .gitignore file"
  ),
  Considerations = c(
    "Where do you want to store your project?",
    "Do you want to use renv for package version control?",
    "Are you creating this project to work on a package?",
    "Should the folder structure be for a publication project?",
    "Do you want to exclude certain files from being tracked by Git?"
  ),
  Output = c(
    "This will be the folder your new project is created within.",
    "If set to `TRUE`, renv will be initialised in your project.",
    "If set to `TRUE`, an extra package development folder will
be created",
    "If set to `TRUE`, extra publication specific folders will
be created",
    "If set to `TRUE`, a GitHub .gitignore file will be created."
  )
)


kable(
  parameter_data,
  format = "html",
  col.names = c(
    "Parameter", "Meaning",
    "Considerations", "Output"
  )
)
```

When using the 'New Project Wizard', you will be prompted to enter these parameters manually by filling in provided boxes or ticking the appropriate checkboxes. Regardless of the method you choose, you will need to make a decision for each parameter to create the appropriate type of project.

## Creating a project using code

Here is the basic code you will need to use, having installed `dfeR`:

```{r create_project, eval = FALSE}
dfeR::create_project(
  path = "C:/path/to/your/new/project",
  init_renv = TRUE,
  include_structure_for_pkg = FALSE,
  create_publication_proj = FALSE,
  include_github_gitignore = TRUE
)
```

### Example use

The below code will create a new project in the specified folder path, with renv initialised, a publication project structure, and a GitHub .gitignore file included.

```{r function_example, eval = FALSE}
# Load the dfeR package
library(dfeR)
# Create a new project with the desired parameters
dfeR::create_project(
  path = "C:/Users/JBLOGGS/repos/my-new-project",
  init_renv = TRUE,
  include_structure_for_pkg = FALSE,
  create_publication_proj = TRUE,
  include_github_gitignore = TRUE
)
```

You can view this by going to the location of the pathway you chose in File Explorer. You should find your new project there, inside a folder with the name you added at the end of your pathway, as below.

![](../man/figures/create_new_project_screenshot.png){fig-alt="Newly created contents of project folder in File Explorer."} You will also need to think about what you want your project to be called and include this in your file path. You can always amend this later.

For example, if you want to create a project called “my-new-project” in the folder you created above, your file path (with the username changed to your username) would be "C:/Users/Msmith/repos/my-new-project".

You can create a project in a different location, but you will need to change the file path accordingly.

You can then open the project by double-clicking on the R project file. You should be able to identify it, as it has an R symbol in a cube, and the file type will be shown as 'R Project'. If you have set `create_publication_proj` to `FALSE`, you will find your folders will look a little different to the above.

You can amend the file structure and names to suit the particular project you are working on, using the file structure created as a template.

## Creating a project using the 'New Project Wizard'

If you are using RStudio, you can also create a new project using the 'New Project Wizard'. This is a user-friendly way to set up a new project without writing any code. To do this, follow these steps:

1.  Open RStudio and go to 'File' \> 'New Project' \> 'New Directory'

2.  Scroll down and click on 'dfeR project template'.

3.  Enter the name of your project under 'Directory name'
            
    -  You can choose a location to save your project by clicking 'Browse'.

4.  Decide whether you want to have a project structure specifically for publications or a package.

    - Leaving these both unticked will give you a project with a generic analysis project structure.

5.  Decide whether you would like a GitHub .gitignore file by ticking or unticking the box.

6.  Click 'Create Project' to set up your new project.

![](../man/figures/project_wizard_screenshot.png){fig-alt="'New Project Wizard' window with option to create dfeR project template open."}

You can also access the 'New Project Wizard' by clicking on the project that you are currently in, in the top-right hand corner and then selecting 'New Project'.

As above, you can access your new project by going to the location of the pathway you chose in File Explorer. You should find your new project there, inside a folder with the name you added at the end of your pathway.

### Troubleshooting

You may hit an error if the `init_renv` parameter is not set to FALSE. This initiates `renv` in the created project, which is best practice. However, the `renv.lock` is set up to record several packages (`rmarkdown`, `testthat`, `renv`, `stringr`). You may get the following error message, letting you know that none of these packages are installed:

*"None of the packages recorded in the lockfile are currently installed."*

This can be rectified by executing `'renv::restore()'` in your console, which will install those packages.
