The goal of dfeR is to help standardise R programming across the Department for Education (DfE), and facilitate sharing of business specific functions, making our code easier to read and write.

## Scope

This package is open to all of DfE and anything we think could be useful to other programmers and analysts can be contributed.

Functionality for dfeR is expected to focus around the following:

1. DfE specific formatting
2. Working with Microsoft SQL Databases
3. Templates for analytical projects
4. Publication R Markdown Templates
5. API wrappers for use internally
6. Geography lookup files and helper functions

Documentation for what has been included in the package so far is on our [pkgdown site](http://dfe-analytical-services.github.io/dfeR/).

We are also developing the [dfeshiny](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/dfeshiny) package, and expect any functions specific to public facing R Shiny dashboards will live there.

## Installation

dfeR is not currently available on CRAN. For the time being you can install the development version from GitHub.

If you are using [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) in your project (recommended):

``` r
renv::install("dfe-analytical-services/dfeR")
```

Otherwise:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dfe-analytical-services/dfeR")
```

---

## Proxy

The need for setting proxy settings in order to be able to work with R and Git within the DfE estate has now ended. If you previously run the proxy script in previous versions of the dfeR package, then contact the [Statistics Development Team](statistics.development@education.gov.uk) to assist in cleaning out your system settings.
