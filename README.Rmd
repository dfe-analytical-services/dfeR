The goal of dfeR is to help standardise R programming across the Department for Education (DfE), and facilitate sharing of business specific functions, making our code easier to read and write.

## Scope

This package is open to all of DfE and anything we think could be useful to other programmers and analysts can be contributed.

Functionality for dfeR is expected to focus around the following:

1. DfE specific formatting and helper functions
2. Working with DfE databases
3. Templates for analytical projects
4. API wrappers commonly needed in DfE analysis (where they don't have their own separate package)
5. Geography lookup files and helper functions

Documentation for what has been included in the package so far is on our [pkgdown site](https://dfe-analytical-services.github.io/dfeR/).

### Relevant other packages

We also maintain the [dfeshiny](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/dfeshiny) package, and expect any functions specific to R Shiny applications will live there.

For connecting to data in the [explore education statistics](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/), we are building the [eesyapi](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/eesyapi.R) package. 

There is a [giasr](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/giasr) package, which has been developed for connecting to data in the [get information about schools service](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/).

While we have some DfE specific data in the dfeR package taken from the [Open Geography Portal](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/). If you're looking at getting new data from the portal it is also worth looking at the [boundr](https://github.com/francisbarton/boundr) package, as this gives more functions for directly extracting data from there.

## Installation

### Install CRAN version

dfeR is available on CRAN and can be installed using [pak](https://pak.r-lib.org/) for faster and more reliable package installation.


Then install dfeR from CRAN:

``` r
# If you don’t have pak installed yet, install it first using
# install.packages("pak") is required 
pak::pak("dfeR")
```

### Install development version from GitHub

If you are using
[renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) in your
project (recommended):

``` r
renv::install("dfe-analytical-services/dfeR")
```

Otherwise:

``` r
# If you don’t have pak installed yet, install it first using
# install.packages("pak") 
pak::pak("dfe-analytical-services/dfeR")
```

## Proxy

The need for setting proxy settings in order to be able to work with R and Git within the DfE estate has now ended. If you previously run the proxy script in previous versions of the dfeR package, then contact the [Statistics Development Team](mailto:statistics.development@education.gov.uk) to assist in cleaning out your system settings.

pretty_filesize(77777777)

# Calculate elapsed time and present prettily
start <- Sys.time()
end <- Sys.time() + 789890
pretty_time_taken(start, end)

# Round 5's up instead of bankers round used by round() in base R
round_five_up(2.5)
round(2.5) # base R

# Custom formatting for academic and financial years
format_ay(202425)
format_fy(202425)
format_ay_reverse("2024/25")
