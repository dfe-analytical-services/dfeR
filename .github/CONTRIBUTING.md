# Contributing to dfeR

Ideas for `dfeR` should first be raised as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/dfeR) after which anyone is free to write the code and create a pull request for review. 

For a detailed discussion on contributing to R packages in the tidyverse, please see the [development contributing guide](https://rstd.io/tidy-contrib) and their [code review principles](https://code-review.tidyverse.org/). Full knowledge of this isn't needed, though some awareness of general principles will be useful.

## Basics

When contributing to dfeR you should work on a new branch taken from main.

Any pull request must be reviewed and approved by at least one admin user before it can be merged. 

### Fixing typos

You can fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors in the documentation directly using the GitHub web interface, as long as the changes are made in the _source_ file. 
This generally means you'll need to edit [roxygen2 comments](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/roxygen2.html) in an `.R`, not a `.Rd` file. 
You can find the `.R` file that generates the `.Rd` by reading the comment in the first line.

### Bigger changes

If you want to make a bigger change, it's a good idea to first file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s needed. 

- If you’ve found a bug, please file an issue that illustrates the bug with a minimal 
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex) (this will also help you write a unit test, if needed).

- See the tidyverse guide on [how to create a great issue](https://code-review.tidyverse.org/issues/) for more advice.

Where possible, we'd recommend following the [Test Driven Development (TDD)](https://testdriven.io/test-driven-development/) approach:

- Write tests for the behaviour you want
- Write just enough code so that the tests pass
- Continue to improve code while keeping tests passing

## Handy workflows

Keyboard shortcuts for the `devtools` package to use while in RStudio:
- `load_all()` (Ctrl-Shift-L): Load code with dfeR package
- `test()` (Ctrl-Shift-T): Run tests
- `document()` (Ctrl-Shift-D): Rebuild docs and NAMESPACE
- `check()` (Ctrl-Shift-E): Check complete package

We recommend using the [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/index.html) package where possible for consistency and simplicity.

## Adding package dependencies

Add any packages the package users will need with:
``` r
usethis::use_package(pkgname, type = "imports")
```

Add any packages that package developers only may need with:
``` r
usethis::use_package(pkgname, type = "suggests")
```

## Updating the README

There are two README files that are linked with a pre-commit-hook to ensure are kept in sync.

Make all changes to the `README.Rmd` file and then run the following line to rebuild:

``` r
devtools::build_readme()
```

## Updating the package version

Once changes have been completed, reviewed and are ready for use in the wild, you can increment the package version using:
``` r
usethis::use_version()
```

Once you've incremented the version number, it'll offer to perform a commit on your behalf, so all you then need to do is push to GitHub.

### Code style

New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). We use [lintr](https://lintr.r-lib.org/articles/lintr.html) to scan styling on pull requests, this will automatically run and add comments for any code that is failing the standards we'd expect. Where these happen, please proactively resolve these as we are unlikely to approve pull requests that have styling issues.

You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply most of the styling using:

``` r
styler::style_pkg()
```

To check for any further styling issues locally, use:

``` r
lintr::lint_package()
```

[styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) will not fix all linting issues, so we recommend using that first, then using [lintr](https://lintr.r-lib.org/articles/lintr.html) to check for places you may need to manually fix styling issues such as line length or not using snake_case.

We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests, we expect all new functions to have some level of test coverage.
