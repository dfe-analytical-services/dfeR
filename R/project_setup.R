#' Create a standard project structure for analytical projects
#'
#' This function creates the the following structure to be used for analytical projects: \cr \cr
#' 1. R - A folder for your R scripts and functions \cr
#' 2. Data - A folder for copies of raw data to be stored if required \cr
#' 3. Outputs - A folder to populate in run.R with all outputs. Note outputs are considered disposable and not inteded to be tracked when using git. \cr
#' 4. Queries - A folder for copies of any SQL scripts used \cr
#' 5. Misc - A folder for anything else \cr
#' 6. README.md - A markdown file where documentation is to be kept \cr
#' 7. report.Rmd - An example R Markdown. Note .Rmd is in root so that relative references can be used easily.
#' 8. run.R - An R file that when run populates the outputs folder with your analysis \cr
#' @param path Folder path where you would like to create the structure. Default is current working directory
#' @return Updated folder structure
#' @keywords project, setup
#' @export
#' @examples
#' \dontrun{
#' project_setup()
#' }
